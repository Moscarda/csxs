What is this? A command line tool written in [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) for creating, compiling, packaging,
debugging, and deploying extensions for Adobe&reg; Creative Suite&reg;. It's easy as to use and as it is powerful.

It is designed to solve workflow problems and constraints that come from using [Flash Builder](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flash-builder.html).
As an added bonus, projects created with this tool contain boilerplate to resolve strange platform bugs we've encountered.

We used to it to build our [Creative Market Photoshop Extension](https://creativemarket.com/photoshop-extension).

### Advantages

  * Use any editor you want!
  * All project settings live in a single JSON file ([documentation](docs/configuration.md)).
  * Automated signing, deploys to S3, changelog management, git tagging, etc.
  * Open source!

### Requirements

  * [Build and Install Node.js](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation)
  * Install [NPM](http://npmjs.org/): `curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh`
  * Install [csxs](https://github.com/creativemarket/csxs): `npm install -g csxs`

## Getting Started

To create a new project, make an empty folder and use the "create" target to set up
an empty project that's ready to go for development. To compile a debug version and add
it to Photoshop, use the "debug" target.

```sh
# create a folder for a project
$ mkdir my-extension
$ cd my-extension

# create the project & start it
$ csxs create
$ csxs debug --launch
```

More information about building and publishing the extension will be
listed in the ["README.md"](project/README.md) created with the project.

## Project Structure

### Configuration

All project settings live in **"csxs.json"** ([guide](docs/configuration.md)). The settings in this file are synthesized to various
XML files needed by the Flex Compiler and Signing Tool during the build process.

## Advanced Topics

### Conditional Compilation

The following [conditional compilation](http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/html/help.html?content=compilers_21.html) variables are automatically provided:

* `CONFIG::version` (string)
* `CONFIG::debug` (boolean)
* `CONFIG::release` (boolean)

#### Adding Custom Variables

Custom variables can be set by adding them to the "properties" object in "csxs.json". The values *must* be scalar.
The one exception to this is if you want different values for debug builds and release builds. In this case, provide an
object with two properties: "debug" and "release".

```json
{
	"properties": {
		"url": {
			"debug": "http://sandbox.domain.com",
			"release": "http://domain.com"
		}
	}
}
```

### Editing XML and MXI Files

XML and MXI files in the project are populated by the properties in ["csxs.json"](docs/configuration.md) at build time.
For complicated extensions, it might be necessary to make changes in these files. Any of the files in
the "src/" folder can be safely edited. Template variables should follow [handlebars syntax](http://handlebarsjs.com/).

### Automated S3 Deployment

Automated deployment of releases is done with the "publish" target. The build tool will compile a release build,
package it as a *.zxp installer, and place it on [S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) (along with a history of changes).
All that's needed is an S3 account. See the [documentation on the `"s3"` property](docs/configuration.md#s3) to see how to
add S3 configuration.

```sh
$ csxs publish
```

#### Deployed Files & Folders

<table width="100%">
	<tr>
		<td valign="top"><strong>changes/</strong></td>
		<td valign="top">Contains changelogs by version and a "master.txt" file (an aggregated list).</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top">update.xml</td>
		<td valign="top">Update info read by Adobe Extension Manager.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top">update.json</td>
		<td valign="top">Update info in JSON format.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top">MyExtension.zxp</td>
		<td valign="top">Latest version.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top">MyExtension.0.0.1.zxp</td>
		<td valign="top">Archival version.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

### Automated Git Tagging

When running "publish", HEAD will be tagged with the version being deployed for reference. It is the equivalent of running:

```sh
$ git tag vX.X.X
$ git push origin --tags
```

### Multiple Configurations

In the rare case that a project needs multiple configurations (i.e. multiple "csxs.json" files), you can specify the configuration file to use from the command line with the `--config` option.

```sh
$ csxs target --config=csxs_free.json
$ csxs target --config=csxs_paid.json
```

If this option is not provided, "csxs.json" will be read by default.

## Footnotes

* 100% compatible with Mac OSX. Windows support is partial / spotty right now.
* If your project needs host adapters, they have to be extracted manually from Extension Builder ([Adobe Forums thread](http://forums.adobe.com/message/5245782)).
